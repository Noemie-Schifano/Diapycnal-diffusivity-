# -------------------- NetCDF of diapycnal diffusivities (effective and parameterized) -------------
1. Diffusivities experienced by passive tracer patches can be found in this repertory
       ---> "rrexnumNL-scheme_diffusivities.nc", with:
               - "NL" the number of sigma-levels used,
               - "scheme" the advective scheme used.
      NB: "rsvweno5" designed the combination of advective scheme named WENO5 in
           the article, while "rsweno5" is for combination named WENO5_H            
3. Diffusivities for tracer 1 released above the abyssal plain correspond to the index ntpas=0
4. Diffusivities for tracer 2 released above the abyssal plain correspond to the index ntpas=1
